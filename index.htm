    <H1> HTML's peculiar syntax</H1>
    Who came up with HTML's peculiar syntax? It just goes over my head how it might possible be considered convenient to type every keyword twice. I know, compared with something like C it is easier to see where every scope ends, but still, it is a waste of keystrokes to me.
