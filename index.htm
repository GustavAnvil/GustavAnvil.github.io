    <h2> On HTML's peculiar syntax</h2>
      Who came up with HTML's peculiar syntax? It just goes over my head how it might possible be considered convenient to type every keyword twice. I know, compared with something like C it is easier to see where every scope ends, but still, it seems like a massive waste of keystrokes to me, especially compared to languages like Markdown or org-mode.

      <h3>XML</h3>
      I know, this other Markup language does the same, but does that prove anything?
      <h2>The plain text look</h2>
      I like the look of plain text. It simply looks "clean". There are some things to consider when writing in plain text, though:
      <ul>
	<li>Setting margins may require manual work </li>
	<li>Bullet lists definitely require manual work</li>
	<li>Adding empasis is harder, by lack of such conveniences as bold or italic text</li>
      </ul>

      That's why I have decided to merely give this HTML document a plain text <strong>look</strong>, instead of using actual plain text. For this, all I had to do was setting a monospace font, and using margins and the "max-width" property in CSS to mimic the relatively short lines commonly used in plain text documents.
